# Rare-disease-identification

This repository presents an approach using **ontologies** and **weak supervision** to identify rare diseases from clinical notes. The idea is illustrated below and the data annotation is available for download.

## Entity linking and ontology matching

## Rare disease annotations
The annotations of rare disease mentions created from this research are available in the folder [`data annotation`](https://github.com/acadTags/Rare-disease-identification/tree/main/data%20annotation).
