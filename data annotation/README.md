The annotated data are available in [`Rare disease annotations from 312 MIMIC-III discharge summaries.csv`]().

## Data sampling and annotation procedure
(i) Randomly sampled 500 discharge summaries (DS) from MIMIC-III
(ii) 312 of the 500 DS have at least one positive UMLS mention linked to ORDO, as identified by SemEHR; there are altogether 1073 UMLS (or ORDO) mentions.
(iii) 3 medical informatics researchers (staff or PhD) annotated the 1073 mentions, regarding whether they are phenotypes matched to UMLS and ORDO. Contradictions resolved by a research staff having biomedical background.

| gold   mention-to-UMLS label                 | Whether the   mention-UMLS pair indicate a correct phenotype of the patient (i.e. a   positive mention that correctly matches to the UMLS concept), 1 if correct, 0   if not.                                 |
| gold   UMLS-to-ORDO label                    | Whether the matching   is correct from the UMLS concept to the ORDO concept, 1 if correct, 0 if not.                                                                                                          |
